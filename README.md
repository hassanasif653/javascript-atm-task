Simple ATM Simulation
Project Overview
This is a simple ATM machine simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interact with a basic ATM interface by inserting a card, entering a PIN, and performing common banking transactions.

Features
Insert card and enter PIN authentication

Balance inquiry to display current account balance

Cash deposit and withdrawal with amount input and validation

Cancel option to reset and restart the session

Clear and user-friendly interface with simple alerts for feedback

How It Works
User clicks "Insert Card" to start and is prompted to enter their PIN.

If the PIN matches the stored value, the user can choose from four ATM options.

Deposit and Withdrawal require inputting an amount to update the balance.

The balance is updated dynamically based on user transactions.

Cancelling returns the user to the start state.

Technologies Used
HTML for page structure

CSS for styling and visual design

JavaScript for core logic, DOM manipulation, and user interaction
